# PC Maintenance — Hands‑On Session

A short portfolio entry documenting a hands‑on PC maintenance session where I learned to safely disassemble, inspect, and reassemble a desktop PC. This README explains what I did, the materials and tools used, step‑by‑step actions, outcomes, and how to reproduce the experience.

## Overview
- Project type: Hands‑on lab / practical exercise
- Topic: PC maintenance — dismantling, inspecting hardware, and reassembly
- Date: 30 October (update with year if desired)
- Location: [e.g., Faculty of Computing lab / workshop name]

## Summary
This session gave practical exposure to computer hardware components and maintenance tasks. Activities included opening a desktop case, identifying internal components (HDD, PSU, motherboard, RAM, CPU cooler), checking cable connections, and reassembling the system. The aim was to translate theoretical knowledge into hands‑on skills.

## Objectives
- Learn safe procedures for opening and handling PC hardware
- Identify internal components and connectors
- Practice removing and installing hard drives, power connectors, and expansion cards
- Understand basic troubleshooting and cleaning techniques
- Build confidence to perform routine PC maintenance

## Materials & Tools
- Desktop PC (target system for the session)
- Phillips screwdriver (Philips #2 recommended)
- Anti‑static wrist strap (recommended)
- Compressed air can (for dust removal)
- Isopropyl alcohol wipes (for cleaning contacts, optional)
- Small brush (optional)
- External drive enclosure or SATA-to-USB adapter (optional, for testing drives)
- Replacement screws and zip ties

## Procedure (high level)
1. Power down the PC and unplug all cables.
2. Ground yourself (anti‑static strap or touch a grounded metal surface).
3. Remove side panel(s) to expose internal components.
4. Inspect inside visually:
   - Check for dust, loose cables, bulging capacitors, or damaged connectors.
5. Identify key components:
   - Power supply (PSU), motherboard, CPU and cooler, RAM, storage drives (HDD/SSD), optical drive, expansion cards.
6. Disconnect power and data cables from the drive(s) you plan to remove.
7. Remove the drive or component carefully (unscrew mounting, slide out).
8. Clean dust with compressed air; avoid spinning fans with direct air pressure.
9. Reinstall components, ensuring cables are routed and seated correctly.
10. Reassemble the case, reconnect external cables, and power up to verify operation.
11. Troubleshoot any boot or hardware issues if they appear (check POST LEDs/beeps, reseat RAM, verify power connectors).



## Skills Gained
- Hardware identification and familiarity with common PC components
- Safe handling and anti‑static practices
- Basic troubleshooting (power/connectivity checks)
- Hands‑on experience with disassembly and reassembly
- Improved confidence in routine maintenance and upgrades

## Outcomes & Reflection
- Successfully dismantled and reassembled a desktop PC
- Gained practical insight into how components connect and interact
- Learned small but important details (e.g., correct cable orientation, screw sizing)
- This kind of hands‑on session helps bridge the gap between theory and real hardware troubleshooting
